# `/src/main/resources/trained_vectors/embeddings`

- This folder is for the pre-trained GloVe models (e.g. `glove.6B.50d.txt`)

- Retrieved from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

- **Note:** This folder doesn't contain any pre-trained GloVe filemodel in order to save space (each file is large).
  - You can use a different pre-trained GloVe filemodel (AKA pre-trained word vector), but adding it to this folder won't add
  it to the Git repo as it is ignored.
